## <span style="text-decoration: underline">Objectives</span>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Todayâ€™s malware analysis tools, especially those on kernel attacks, face the barrier of insufficient code path coverage to fully expose malicious behaviours, as that requires systematic exploration of kernel states. Although symbolic execution is the well-established solution for benign programs' code coverage, it does not overcome that barrier because of its susceptibility to attacks from the running target under analysis and incapability of managing complex kernel execution. This project is to innovate cutting-edge techniques to automatically and systematically generate code paths for maliciously-influenced kernel behaviours. The outcome includes a system infrastructure for an analysis tool to transparently and securely control the target in either user or kernel mode; and hybrid symbolic execution algorithms based on that infrastructure to explore kernel execution paths. It not only enhances kernel-oriented security analysis, testing, and certification with a widened code coverage, but also strengthens malware analysis with a deepened understanding of underlying kernel activities.
